          Zone to zone rates give you the ultimate flexibily to define your service area into various zones, so that you
          can define flat rates from point to point. For each zone, you will attach any number of zip codes to it and you
          will be able to define a flat rate from zone to zone. A zone to zone flat rate will always override a distance based
          rate if the zone to zone rate exists for the quote request.
